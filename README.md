# School Library

> In this project, I started building my school library app. In this initial step, I implemented the classes to represent students and teachers. Next, I used the Decorator design pattern to validate and correct the names of people. I then finish creating the remaining classes for our school library and created the associations between them. Finally, I created a form of UI for my school library app. This way it can be invoked as an executable and not something a user can use in IRB exclusively.

## Built With

- Ruby
- Rubocop

## Getting Started

- Open command line
